# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project aims to analyse and visualise patient-level data of South Korea's COVID-19 cases found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset).
The project aims to gain valuable insights from the data and provide recommendations for effectively fighting the pandemic based on the findings.
The key objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Exploratory Analysis: Conduction of a comprehensive exploration of the COVID-19 patient-level data to understand its characteristics and uncover important patterns and trends.
This analysis will involve examining various factors such as demographics, geographical distribution of cases, susceptibility to illness, fatality rates.

2. Insight Generation: Utilization of data science techniques and statistical methods to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
Identify correlations, associations, and significant factors that contribute to the spread and impact of COVID-19 in South Korea.
These insights will help in understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and its implications for public health.

3. Visualization: Presentation of the acquired insights in a clear and visually appealing manner using appropriate data visualization techniques.
Visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps will be employed to effectively communicate the findings to a broad audience, including policymakers and the general public.

4. Recommendations: Based on the analysis and insights gained, formulation of a list of actionable recommendations to combat the spread of pandemic.
These recommendations will cover a range of strategies, including preventive measures, resource allocation and other relevant interventions.
The goal is to provide evidence-based guidance for decision-makers in effectively managing and controlling the spread of COVID-19.
